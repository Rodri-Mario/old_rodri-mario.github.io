<h3 id="About">About</h3>
<p>
    Thanks for visiting my site! My name is Mario and I'm an aspiring software designer with an interest in anything that beeps and boops. I'm currently a third year student at <a href="https://wp.stolaf.edu/">St. Olaf</a> pursuing degrees in computer science and mathematics. I hope to find a career that allows me to pursue my interests in technology, while also fully utilizing my creativity and ingenuity. 
<br>
    In my free time, I settle down by reading a nice book, collecting and battling Pokémon, or playing board games with friends.
